# Ecovera Solutions – Company Profile Website (PRD)

## Project Overview

Ecovera Solutions is a fictional company specializing in eco-friendly and sustainable solutions. The **Ecovera Solutions – Company Profile Website** is a static, informational website that showcases the company's mission, values, services, and contact information. This site will serve both as an official web presence for the company and as a portfolio project for its developer. It is designed with an eco-conscious aesthetic, using nature-inspired design elements (colors, imagery) and sustainable typography (fonts like *Ryman Eco*) to reinforce the brand’s commitment to sustainability. The website will be built as a modern single-developer project using a code-first approach, without a content management system (CMS), ensuring simplicity and maintainability for a first version (v1). Key characteristics include:

* **Informational Focus:** Provides clear information about Ecovera Solutions – who they are, what they offer (services/solutions), their mission and values, and how to contact them. There are no user accounts or e-commerce features.
* **Responsive Design:** The site will be fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance, offering a polished user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Sustainability Theme:** Visual design elements (color scheme, images) and typography choices reflect an eco-friendly theme. Font preferences include **Green Leaf**, **Grassland**, and **Ryman Eco** – with *Ryman Eco* emphasized as a primary font due to its sustainability concept (it’s known as an ink-saving, environmentally friendly typeface). These fonts will be integrated via web fonts or @font-face so that the site’s typography aligns with the brand identity.
* **Developer & Portfolio Emphasis:** This project is intended as a learning and portfolio piece, so the code structure, readability, and modern best practices are important. The PRD (this document) will be included in the repository for reference. The developer will focus on clean code, consistent style, and include some interactive polish (smooth animations, hover effects, etc.) to demonstrate front-end skills and attention to detail.

## Objective

The primary objective of the Ecovera Solutions website is to establish a compelling online profile for the company while serving as a showcase of the developer’s abilities. The site should meet the following goals:

* **Brand Presentation:** Clearly communicate Ecovera’s brand story, mission, and values (with an emphasis on sustainability and eco-friendliness). The look and feel should reinforce the brand (e.g., using a green color palette and eco-themed fonts/icons to give a "green" impression).
* **Service Showcase:** Detail the services or solutions Ecovera offers, in an engaging way that potential clients or partners can easily understand. Each service may have a brief description, and if applicable, illustrative icons or images.
* **Contact and Conversion:** Provide an easy way for visitors to get in touch (contact form and/or contact information) and encourage inquiries. A clear call-to-action (CTA) should be present (e.g., a "Contact Us" or "Get in Touch" section/button).
* **Usability and Responsiveness:** Ensure the site is easy to navigate and works well on all common devices and browsers. Navigation should be intuitive, and content organized logically into distinct pages/sections (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.).
* **Performance and SEO:** Build the site to be fast-loading and search-engine friendly. Use Next.js features for optimized performance (such as static generation) and include basic SEO metadata (unique page titles, meta descriptions, semantic HTML structure) so that the site can be discovered via search engines.
* **Portfolio Quality:** Demonstrate modern web development practices. This means using clean, maintainable code (TypeScript for type safety, modular components, etc.), implementing interactive enhancements (e.g., subtle animations on scroll or hover), and paying attention to design details (pixel-perfect alignment with any provided design, consistent spacing, and branding fidelity).
* **No-CMS Simplicity:** Since no CMS is used in v1, the site’s content will be managed through the codebase (static content and possibly Markdown files). This objective ensures that even without a CMS, the content is easy to update by a developer and the site remains lightweight.

In summary, the website should effectively communicate *“Who is Ecovera Solutions and why you should care”* in a visually pleasing, performant manner, while also highlighting the developer’s capability to create a polished, modern website from scratch.

## Tech Stack

This project will utilize a modern web tech stack, focusing on technologies that support a fast, static site and a smooth developer experience:

* **Framework & Language:** **Next.js** (React framework) with **TypeScript**. Next.js provides server-side rendering and static site generation which will be used to pre-render pages for speed and SEO. TypeScript will ensure type-safe code and easier maintainability.
* **Routing:** Using Next.js **Pages Router** (the `/pages` directory) for defining routes like Home, About, Services, Contact, etc. This gives file-based routing out-of-the-box (e.g., `pages/index.tsx` for home, `pages/about.tsx` for the About page).
* **Styling:** **CSS** will be used for styling, with options for modern techniques:

  * Use global CSS (e.g., a `globals.css` for base styles and variables like colors and font imports) and **CSS Modules** for component-specific styles, *or* integrate **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach. Given the focus on custom design and branding, a combination can be used: Tailwind for rapid layout and responsiveness, alongside custom CSS for fine-tuned styles and animations.
  * If Tailwind is chosen, include it in the setup (PostCSS configuration) and define a custom color palette and fonts in the Tailwind config to match Ecovera’s branding. Otherwise, use conventional CSS/SCSS with variables for brand colors and classes for typography.
* **Typography:** **Web Fonts Integration** for the chosen fonts:

  * *Ryman Eco* (primary sustainable font) – include via self-hosted font files or a CDN/webfont service since it’s a specialty font.
  * *Green Leaf* and *Grassland* (decorative fonts) – these can be used for special headings or the logo. They should also be included via webfont files or imported if available. Fallback fonts should be defined (e.g., sans-serif or serif as appropriate) to ensure good UX if custom fonts fail to load.
  * The site will likely use Ryman Eco for headings or highlighted text to emphasize the eco theme, and a clean sans-serif (or Ryman Eco itself if highly legible) for body text. The developer will ensure font loading is optimized (using `@font-face` in CSS or Next.js built-in font optimization if possible).
* **State Management:** Not required (the site is mostly static). React’s built-in state can handle any interactive component needs (e.g., for a contact form or menu toggle). No Redux or complex state libraries are needed for v1.
* **Content Management:** **Static content and Markdown** – All content is stored within the project:

  * Text content may be hard-coded in the pages or stored in separate Markdown files under a `/content` folder (e.g., `about.md`, `services.md`). If Markdown files are used, a library like `gray-matter` (for front-matter parsing) and a Markdown renderer (such as `remark` or `next-mdx-remote` for MDX) will be utilized to load content at build time via Next.js data fetching (`getStaticProps`).
  * No external database or CMS; all data (like lists of services or team members) can be kept in local JSON/TS files or as constants in the code. This keeps v1 simple and fast.
* **Libraries & Tools:**

  * **Styling/Animation Libraries:** Possibly utilize lightweight libraries for enhancement – e.g., **Framer Motion** or **React Awesome Reveal** for scroll-based reveal animations, and simple CSS transitions for hovers. These are optional but recommended to achieve the "cool polish" (for example, fading in sections on scroll, smooth scrolling to anchors, etc.).
  * **Icons:** Use an icon library (such as **React Icons** or **HeroIcons**) to include social media icons or small illustrative icons (like phone, email, eco-themed icons for bullet points) to avoid creating custom SVGs from scratch.
  * **Form Handling:** For the contact form (if implemented), use basic HTML5 form features for v1. No complex form library is needed. If an email service integration is desired in future, we might consider an API or service, but for now a simple form or mailto link suffices.
  * **Build/Deploy Tools:** Next.js comes with a dev server and build toolchain (Webpack or Turbopack). Deployment can be easily done on **Vercel** (given its seamless Next.js support) or any static hosting since we’ll export a static site. However, specifics of deployment are outside the scope of this PRD; just ensure the app builds cleanly for production.
* **Version Control:** Git will be used to track the project. The repository will contain all source code and documentation (including this PRD in Markdown). This ensures any changes to requirements or scope can be tracked alongside code changes.

The above stack ensures the project is using current industry-standard tools, can be developed and deployed efficiently by a solo developer, and can easily be built upon in the future (for example, integrating a CMS or adding features in later versions if needed).

## Folder Structure

The project will be organized in a logical manner for a Next.js application. Below is the expected folder and file structure (in a tree format), which promotes clarity and easy navigation for the developer:

```

└── ... (other config files like next.config.js, tsconfig.json, etc.)
```

**Notes on structure:** The `pages` directory defines the website’s routes. Each page will import necessary components from `components`. The `Header` and `Footer` components can be included on every page via a top-level `Layout` component or directly in the `_app.tsx` so they wrap all pages. Static files in `public` (like images or fonts) can be referenced by their path (e.g., `/images/logo.png`). The `content` folder is optional for organizing text content; for example, the developer could write the company story in `about.md` and load it within `pages/about.tsx` so non-developers could update that file without touching code. Styling can be handled by CSS modules in the `styles` folder or by Tailwind utility classes (if Tailwind is set up, it will generate a `/styles/tailwind.css` that is imported as well). All TypeScript source files (`.tsx`/`.ts`) will live under `pages` and `components`. Configuration and metadata files (like Next.js config, ESLint, etc.) will be in the root as needed.

This structure should keep assets and code well-organized for a solo developer, making it easy to locate files and expand the project in the future.

## Development Plan

The development will proceed in a series of logical steps, from setup to feature implementation, ensuring that at each stage the project remains functional and incremental improvements are made. This plan can also guide AI tools (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) by breaking down tasks into clear prompts. Below is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initial Project Setup:**

   * Initialize a new Next.js project (e.g., using `create-next-app` with the `--typescript` flag for TypeScript support). Confirm the development server runs (`npm run dev`).
   * Set up version control (git repository) and make an initial commit with the base Next.js structure. Add basic project info to `README.md`.
   * Install any initial dependencies: for example, if using Tailwind CSS, follow the setup guide (install `tailwindcss` and related packages, generate `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`). If using other libraries (like Framer Motion for animations or a Markdown parser), install them now as well.
   * (Optional) Add the font files for **Ryman Eco**, **Green Leaf**, **Grassland** to the `public/fonts` directory, or plan the method to include them (e.g., Google Fonts or CSS @font-face). Verify that the fonts are licensed for web embedding if using downloadable files.

2. **Global Layout and Styling Configuration:**

   * **Layout & Navigation:** Create the `Header` component (`/components/Header.tsx`) with the company logo and a navigation menu. The header should include the site logo on the left (this could be an image `logo.png` or a styled text with a decorative font like Green Leaf) and a nav menu on the right with links to Home, About, Services, Contact. Implement the Header in a responsive manner:

     * On large screens, display the nav links horizontally.
     * On small screens, use a “hamburger” menu icon that toggles a mobile menu (this can be a simple dropdown panel or drawer with the links). This behavior may use a small React state hook to control menu visibility.
   * Create the `Footer` component (`/components/Footer.tsx`) with company info and useful links. The footer could include:

     * Company name and © year.
     * Links or icons for social media (if any, e.g., placeholders for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn).
     * Contact info snippet (address, phone, email) or a call-to-action to contact.
     * Ensure the footer is styled to complement the overall design (possibly a dark background with light text if that fits the branding).
   * **Global Page Structure:** Implement a `Layout` component (`/components/Layout.tsx`) that wraps page content with the Header at the top and Footer at the bottom. The Layout can also add a consistent `<main>` container for page content (for accessibility and consistent padding/margins).

     * Use `_app.tsx` to inject global layout: In `pages/_app.tsx`, wrap the `Component` with the `Layout` component so that every page will include the header and footer by default. Also import `globals.css` (or Tailwind's base styles) here.
   * **Styling Setup:** Create `styles/globals.css` with base styles:

     * Include CSS resets or [Next's built-in CSS reset](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) if needed.
     * Import web fonts: use `@font-face` rules or `@import` statements to load Ryman Eco and other fonts, making sure to specify font-family names for usage in CSS.
     * Define root variables or utility classes for brand colors (e.g., `--color-primary: #3a7d44` for a green shade, etc.) and common styles if not using Tailwind. If Tailwind is used, configure the theme (colors, fonts) in `tailwind.config.js` to include Ecovera’s branding (e.g., primary color, fontFamily with 'Ryman Eco', etc.).
   * **Navigation Functionality:** Use Next.js `Link` component for navigation links in Header (e.g., `<Link href="/about">About</Link>`), so that routing is client-side and seamless. Test that clicking links in Header (and any in Footer) navigates to the appropriate pages (which might be blank templates at this stage).
   * Commit the progress (basic layout with header and footer, global styles configured).

3. **Home Page (`pages/index.tsx`):**
   Implement the Home page as the main landing page that gives an overview and directs users to other parts of the site. Key sections and components on this page:

   * **Hero Section:** Likely at the top of the home page. This could be implemented via a `HeroSection.tsx` component. It will include a catchy tagline or mission statement of Ecovera Solutions, possibly a sub-heading or brief description of what the company does, and a prominent call-to-action button (“Learn More”, “Our Services”, or “Contact Us” depending on what we want to direct the user to first). The hero might use a background image (e.g., a nature or renewable energy themed image in `public/images/hero-bg.jpg`) or a solid color with illustrative graphic. Overlay the hero text on this background. Ensure the text is accessible (good contrast). If using Ryman Eco or a decorative font for the hero text, make sure it’s large and readable.
   * **Overview/Mission Section:** A section that briefly introduces the company’s mission and values. This can be a paragraph of text (from content) along with a small image or icon. It might highlight what makes Ecovera unique (for instance, “sustainable innovations”, “eco-friendly consulting”, etc.). Keep it concise on the home page with maybe a link “Read more about our mission” that goes to the About page.
   * **Services Preview:** Showcase the core services/solutions. Possibly display 3-4 key services in summary (e.g., each with an icon and a short 1-2 sentence description). Each service item could use a `ServiceCard` component (with an icon or image, a title, and short text). For example, if Ecovera offers “Green Energy Consulting”, “Waste Reduction Audits”, “Eco-friendly Product Design”, those would each be summarized here. Include a link or button “View All Services” to navigate to the Services page for full details.
   * **Call-To-Action Section:** At the bottom of the home content (above the footer), have a strong call-to-action. This could be a banner or highlighted box encouraging visitors to contact Ecovera or to consult with them on a project. For instance, “Ready to go green? **Contact Ecovera Solutions** to discuss sustainable solutions for your business.” along with a button linking to the Contact page.
   * **Home Page Styling & Assets:** Use engaging visuals – perhaps icons for each service (these can be from a library or simple SVGs). Ensure consistent color usage (the primary brand green for buttons and highlights, etc.). Add some subtle animations: e.g., fade up each service card as it scrolls into view (using a CSS animation or a scroll-reveal library). The hero’s call-to-action button can have a hover effect (such as a slight grow or color change).
   * Implement and test responsiveness: The home sections should stack vertically on mobile and use appropriate font sizes. The hero image (if any) should be responsive (using CSS `background-size: cover` or `<Image>` component from Next for optimization).
   * Commit the Home page implementation.

4. **About Page (`pages/about.tsx`):**
   Build the About Us page to provide a deeper insight into Ecovera Solutions. This page will contain rich static content about the company. Structure and features:

   * **Company Story & Mission:** A section with a few paragraphs of text describing the company’s background, mission statement, and values. This content can be sourced from a markdown file (e.g., `content/about.md`) for convenience. The developer can parse and render it or directly write JSX with the content. Ensure headings and paragraphs are styled nicely. Possibly include a relevant image (e.g., team or nature image) to add visual interest.
   * **Team Section (Optional):** If applicable, introduce key team members. This could be a grid of profile cards with a photo, name, title, and maybe a one-liner about each person. If Ecovera Solutions is a small startup, even a single “Our Founder” profile could be showcased. (This can be skipped if no information, but it’s a nice touch for a company profile).
   * **Values or Approach:** A list of core values or principles the company follows (e.g., Sustainability, Innovation, Community). This can be a simple list with an icon and a short description for each value.
   * Keep design elements consistent: use the brand fonts for headings (e.g., Ryman Eco for section titles like "Our Mission"), and ensure the color scheme matches the home page. The about page is likely text-heavy, so ensure readability (proper font size, line height, contrast).
   * If the content is in a markdown file, utilize Next.js data fetching: e.g., use `getStaticProps` in `about.tsx` to read `about.md` from the filesystem, parse it (using `gray-matter` to separate any front-matter like title, and a markdown parser to convert to HTML or MDX to directly include). Render the content within the page. This approach means non-developers could edit the markdown to update the About page without touching code.
   * Test on different devices for layout (text blocks should have adequate padding/margins). Add any relevant small animations or images (for example, a fade-in effect for the team photos on scroll).
   * Commit the About page.

5. **Services Page (`pages/services.tsx`):**
   Develop the Services page to list all offerings of Ecovera Solutions in detail. This page will expand on what was previewed on the Home page. Features:

   * **Services List:** Present a list or grid of the company’s services/solutions. Each service can reuse the `ServiceCard` component (or similar layout):

     * Include a service title, an icon or graphic related to it (for consistency, perhaps use the same icons from the home page but larger or with added detail), and a longer description (a few sentences or bullet points about that service’s features/benefits).
     * If there are many services, structure them in groups or categories if applicable. If only a few (3-5), a simple grid or vertical list is fine.
   * **Service Details Modal (Future Scope):** In v1, each service is described on this page only. (No separate page per service in v1 to keep it simple.) However, ensure the content is clear enough that a visitor gets the necessary detail here. In the future, we might link each service to a dedicated page or a modal with more info (this is out-of-scope for now, but keep code flexible).
   * Possibly include a "Why Choose Us" segment below the services, highlighting what sets Ecovera’s services apart (e.g., certified experts, measurable impact, etc.). This further markets the services.
   * Data handling: The list of services can be stored in a constant or JSON file (e.g., an array of objects with `title, description, icon`). The page can map over this array to generate the list. This avoids hard-coding multiple repetitive JSX blocks and makes it easy to adjust the list or reorder.
   * Style the services page with consistent spacing and alignment. Use a heading at the top ("Our Services") in a nice font. Each `ServiceCard` should have a consistent style (maybe a subtle background color or border, and a hover effect like raising or shadow to indicate interactivity even if not clickable).
   * Ensure mobile friendliness: if using a grid, it should collapse to one column on narrow screens. Icons and text should scale appropriately.
   * Commit the Services page.

6. **Contact Page (`pages/contact.tsx`):**
   Create the Contact page to allow visitors to reach out to Ecovera Solutions. This page should include:

   * **Contact Form:** A form with fields – Name, Email, Phone (optional), and Message. The form can be built using controlled React components or simple uncontrolled form elements. Include labels for accessibility. You can use a component `ContactForm.tsx` if you want to keep it separate from page logic.

     * The form in v1 does not need to be fully functional in terms of sending emails to a server (because we have no backend). However, implement basic validation (e.g., ensure required fields are filled, email is in correct format) on the client side.
     * For submission handling in v1: either use a `mailto:` link (e.g., clicking Submit could open the user's email client pre-filled with the message – a quick solution), or simply log the form data to console with a success message. Clearly indicate to the user that their message was "sent" (even if just simulated) – e.g., display a thank-you alert or message on the page after submission.
     * Keep in mind future enhancement: we might integrate an email API or Next.js API route to actually send the form data via email or store it. But in v1, a full backend integration is out of scope.
   * **Contact Details:** In addition to or instead of a form, list direct contact information:

     * Company address (if provided), phone number, and a contact email address. Each should be easily copyable or clickable (for phone: a `tel:` link, for email: a `mailto:` link).
     * Possibly embed a Google Map showing the office location if relevant (this could be a simple iframe embed). *Note:* If no specific address or if it's not needed, skip the map in v1 to avoid extra complexity.
   * Encourage contact with a short text: e.g., "We’d love to hear from you. Please fill out the form below or use the provided information to get in touch with our team."
   * Style the form to match the site (use the brand colors for the submit button, etc.). Ensure the form is responsive (fields stacking on mobile, full width).
   * Test the form validation and any submission behavior. Even though it's not sending anywhere in v1, it should give feedback (highlight missing fields, etc.).
   * Commit the Contact page.

7. **Additional Content Integration & Utility Pages:**

   * **Static Content Check:** Ensure that all the static text (about info, services descriptions, etc.) is properly included. If Markdown files were prepared for About or Services content, ensure they are parsed and rendered correctly. Double-check for any placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum") and replace it with real content. For any content not provided, the developer or project owner should supply the text by this stage.
   * **SEO & Head elements:** For each page, set up the `<Head>` with appropriate meta tags:

     * Use Next.js Head component (or the `next/head` import) to define unique page titles (`<title>`), meta description, and open graph tags (og\:title, og\:description, perhaps a default image for link sharing). For example, About page title could be "About Us – Ecovera Solutions".
     * Add a favicon for the site (place an icon file in `public/favicon.ico` or appropriate format and include it in `_document.tsx` or in the Head).
     * If a global site metadata configuration is needed (like site name, default description), consider creating a config file or using Next.js custom `_document` to inject common tags.
   * **404 Page:** Create a simple custom 404 page (`pages/404.tsx`) to handle unknown routes. It can have a friendly message ("Page not found") and a link back to Home. This is good practice and enhances completeness of the site.
   * **Analytics (Optional):** Though not required for v1, if this is a portfolio piece, integrating something like Google Analytics or similar can be considered. However, given privacy and scope, it might be skipped in v1. If included, it would involve adding the script or using a Next.js analytics plugin in `_app.tsx`.

8. **Visual Design Polish & Interactivity:**
   At this stage, focus on enhancing the user interface with styling and animations to meet the "cool polish" requirement:

   * **Brand Fidelity:** Revisit colors, spacing, and typography across pages to ensure consistency. All headings should use the designated font (e.g., Ryman Eco or decorative font) and colors. Body text should be legible (maybe use a standard font if Ryman Eco is not ideal for paragraphs, or ensure Ryman Eco is rendered clearly).
   * **Animations:** Implement smooth interactive touches:

     * Use CSS transitions for hover states (e.g., buttons change background color or elevate slightly on hover, links underline or color-shift).
     * Scroll reveal animations: for example, use a library like `framer-motion` or `react-awesome-reveal` to fade in sections or slide them up as they enter the viewport. Apply this to elements like service cards, team photos, etc., to create a dynamic feel as the user scrolls.
     * Hero banner could have a subtle animation, such as a slow background pan/zoom (CSS scale) or a text fade-in on load.
     * Ensure not to overdo animations; keep them subtle and performance-friendly.
   * **Responsive Tweaks:** Double-check the responsive behavior with actual devices or emulator. Fine-tune styles for different breakpoints (e.g., maybe adjust font sizes for smaller screens, ensure touch targets (buttons/links) are adequately sized on mobile).
   * **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verify the site on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Fix any styling issues that might appear (like flexbox gaps, etc.).
   * **Accessibility:** Run a quick accessibility check (Lighthouse or aXe) and fix major issues:

     * All images should have appropriate `alt` text.
     * Ensure color contrast is sufficient (especially for text over images or colored backgrounds).
     * Make sure the site can be navigated via keyboard (focus states on links, etc., are visible).
     * Include `aria` labels if needed (for example, on the mobile menu toggle button to label it "Open navigation menu").
   * Commit changes after polishing the design and interactions.

9. **Final Testing & Content Review:**

   * Go through each page and compare against the requirements:

     * Is all intended content present and correct (company info, service details, contact info)?
     * Do all links (navigation and in-page) work correctly? (e.g., clicking Contact in nav goes to Contact page, the logo in header could navigate back to Home).
     * Test the contact form one more time for validation and user experience.
     * Remove any console.log or debugging code from development.
     * Ensure there are no console errors or React warnings.
     * Perform a Lighthouse audit for performance and SEO. Aim for good performance scores by having optimized images (if any image is large, use Next.js Image for automatic optimization or manually ensure they are compressed), and by using static generation (which Next will handle in production build).
   * If any content is missing or marked as TODO, fill it in now.
   * Once everything looks good, prepare for deployment (if planned). For example, run `npm run build` to generate the production build and make sure it succeeds without errors.
   * Commit the final code. Tag the version as v1.0 in git (optional).

10. **Future Considerations (beyond v1):**
    Although not part of v1 development, note any quick improvements that could be addressed later:

    * For instance, integrating a backend or third-party service for the contact form (to actually send emails) or adding a blog section using Markdown posts if content marketing is desired.
    * These are not done now but acknowledging them ensures the code is written in a way that's extensible (for example, keeping content and presentation somewhat separated so a CMS could be attached later, or keeping components general enough to reuse).
    * No coding action needed here, just documentation of potential next steps.

Each of these steps can be approached one at a time, and the developer (or AI assistant) should verify functionality at each stage before moving on. By following this plan, the project will systematically achieve the full feature set required for the Ecovera Solutions site, with a clear path to completion.

## Required Assets

To build and finalize the website, the following assets and resources are required (to be provided to the developer or created as part of the project):

* **Brand Logo:** An image of the Ecovera Solutions logo (preferably in SVG or high-resolution PNG format). If a custom logo doesn’t exist, a stylized text logo using the chosen fonts (e.g., *Green Leaf* or *Grassland* for a nature-themed look) can be used as a placeholder. This logo will appear in the header and possibly in the footer.
* **Brand Style Guide:** (If available) any definitions of brand colors, fonts, and styling guidelines. In absence of a formal guide, at least a primary color (likely green) and secondary colors should be decided. For example, Primary: a green (#4CAF50 as a sample), Secondary: earthy neutral (brown or gray), Accent: maybe a lighter green or complementary color. These will be used consistently for backgrounds, text, buttons, etc.
* **Font Files or Links:** The custom fonts *Ryman Eco*, *Green Leaf*, *Grassland*:

  * Provide `.ttf` or `.woff` files for these fonts if they are not accessible via a CDN. Ryman Eco is free to download; ensure to include the regular (and maybe bold) variants. Green Leaf and Grassland may be decorative fonts; include those files as well if they are to be used, or find web equivalents.
  * If the fonts are available via Google Fonts or another service, provide the import links or names so the developer can include them easily. (Note: Ryman Eco may need self-hosting as it's not on Google Fonts by default).
* **Text Content:** The written content for each page:

  * Home page: tagline, brief company description, service highlights text, call-to-action text.
  * About page: the full “About Us” narrative, company history/mission text, team bios if any.
  * Services page: names of each service and descriptions for each (a few sentences or bullet points per service).
  * Contact page: contact introductory text (if any), company address, phone, email, and any specific instructions for customers reaching out.
  * Ensure this content is reviewed and finalized by the content writer or stakeholder so that the developer doesn’t have to invent content or leave placeholders.
  * **Content format:** This can be provided as a text/Word document or directly as markdown files. If provided as markdown, the developer can directly drop them into the `/content` folder and use them.
* **Images & Graphics:** Collect and provide any images that will be used on the site:

  * Hero section background/image for the Home page (something evocative of sustainability – e.g., solar panels, plants, people working on green projects).
  * Images or icons for each service (could use vector icons or illustrations; if custom icons are needed, provide those. Otherwise, the developer will use an icon library).
  * Team photos for About page, if featuring team members.
  * Any additional graphics (decorative separators, background patterns) if the design calls for it.
  * All images should be of appropriate quality (not pixelated) and preferably optimized for web (compressed file sizes). Provide high-resolution originals and the developer can optimize them as needed.
* **Icons:** If the design uses specific icons (e.g., social media logos, an icon for phone/email, etc.) provide those if they must match a certain style. Alternatively, specify if an icon library should be used (e.g., "use FontAwesome icons for social links").
* **Environment Details (for deployment):** If the site will be deployed to a specific environment or under a certain domain, provide details:

  * E.g., a domain name (like `ecovera-solutions.com`) if one is planned, and hosting credentials if not using something like Vercel.
  * If using Vercel or Netlify for deployment, provide access or set up an account for the project.
  * (For a personal portfolio deployment, the developer can handle this, but it's noted in case it’s a stakeholder-driven project.)
* **Design Mockups or Wireframes:** (Optional but very useful) If any design sketches or high-fidelity mockups exist for the site’s layout, provide them. This helps ensure the developed site matches the envisioned design. In this project, if no official mockup is given, the developer will design based on the requirements, adhering to common layouts and the brand theme.

Having all the above assets gathered before or early in development ensures there are no blockers (like missing images or content) later in the project. The developer should not have to use filler content for launch – real content and assets should be ready to integrate, so the final site looks complete and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria

For the project to be considered complete and the site ready for launch (version 1.0), the following acceptance criteria must be met. These criteria cover functionality, design, and quality aspects:

* **Complete Pages & Navigation:** All defined pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, plus 404 page) are implemented, populated with the correct content, and linked via the header/navigation. Navigating through the site works seamlessly without errors (client-side transitions via Next.js are working).
* **Design Fidelity:** The website’s appearance aligns with the eco-friendly brand theme:

  * The correct fonts (Ryman Eco, etc.) are loaded and used in the appropriate places (e.g., headings in Ryman Eco or decorative font, body text in a clean font for readability).
  * Brand colors are consistently applied (primary color on buttons/links, appropriate text and background colors as specified). The site looks visually appealing and professional, with cohesive styling.
  * Any provided design mockups or style guidelines are followed closely. If no mockup was given, the layout should be clean and user-friendly, comparable to modern company websites.
* **Responsiveness:** The site is fully responsive. On mobile devices, the layout adapts:

  * The header navigation collapses into a mobile menu that is easy to use.
  * Text is legible without zooming; images and sections stack vertically with proper spacing.
  * No horizontal scrolling or layout breaking at common screen sizes. Test resolutions include mobile (\~375px width), tablet (\~768px), and desktop (≥1024px).
* **Content Accuracy:** All content provided is correctly displayed:

  * Text content (company info, service descriptions, etc.) matches the source material with no typos or missing pieces.
  * All dynamic data (if any) is correctly pulled in (e.g., if markdown was used, it’s rendering properly).
  * Contact information is up to date and correctly formatted.
* **Functional Contact Form:** The contact form on the Contact page is usable:

  * Users can input their information and submit. Even if it’s not sending to a server in v1, the form should validate input (e.g., email looks like an email, required fields are filled) and give appropriate feedback (highlight errors or show a success message).
  * There are no broken or non-working form elements. If using a mailto link, ensure it opens the email client with a properly formatted subject/body.
* **No Console Errors:** Running the site in the browser shows no JavaScript errors or Next.js warnings in the console. All React keys, dependencies, etc., are handled to avoid warnings. The production build (after `next build`) should also show no errors.
* **Performance Optimization:** The site achieves good performance:

  * Pages load quickly (within a second or two on standard networks). Next.js static generation ensures initial load is fast; images should be optimized (use Next Image or proper `<img srcset>` techniques).
  * Use Lighthouse or a similar tool: aim for a high performance score (green in Lighthouse). If any heavy resources are present, ensure they are deferred or optimized.
  * The bundle size is kept reasonable; unnecessary libraries are not included. (For example, if a large animation library was added but not used much, reconsider or configure it to load only when needed).
* **SEO & Metadata:** Each page has appropriate meta tags:

  * Unique and descriptive page titles (e.g., “Ecovera Solutions – Sustainable Consulting and Services” for home).
  * Meta descriptions that include relevant keywords (e.g., mention sustainability, eco-friendly solutions, etc., in natural language) for each page.
  * All images have `alt` text for accessibility and SEO.
  * A favicon is present and the site has basic Open Graph tags (so sharing the site on social media shows a nice preview with an image and description).
* **Accessibility:** The site meets basic accessibility standards:

  * Keyboard navigation works (you can tab through links and form fields).
  * Screen reader basics: the content is structured with proper headings (`<h1>` for the main page title, etc.), ARIA labels used where appropriate (like the mobile menu toggle, form inputs have labels).
  * Contrast is sufficient for text vs background. No important information is conveyed by color alone.
* **Documentation & Code Quality:** The codebase should be clean and documented:

  * Component and function names are meaningful. The project structure is as outlined, or any deviations are minor and sensible.
  * Key components or sections have comments where non-obvious logic is used.
  * The repository contains the PRD (this document) and an updated README that briefly explains how to run the project and any other notes for developers.
  * There should be instructions for how to build/deploy in the README (for portfolio reviewers or for moving to production).
* **Approval of Stakeholders:** (If applicable in a real scenario) The project owners or stakeholders have reviewed the deployed site and confirmed that it meets their expectations for design and content. Since this is a learning project, this criterion might be considered met if the developer themselves is satisfied that it meets all the above and perhaps gets a code review from a mentor or peer.

Each of these criteria should be verified before considering the project complete. Meeting all acceptance criteria ensures that the website is not only functional but also polished and ready for real-world use or presentation in a portfolio.

## Out of Scope (v1)

The first version of the Ecovera Solutions website focuses on core informational features. To keep the project manageable, certain features and enhancements are explicitly **out of scope for v1** (they may be revisited in future versions):

* **Content Management System (CMS):** No CMS or admin interface is included. All content updates require code changes (or editing markdown files in the repo). Integrating a headless CMS (like Contentful, Sanity) or a traditional CMS is out of scope for now.
* **User Authentication & Accounts:** There are no login or user account features on the site. (E.g., no user registration, profile pages, or gated content.) The site is entirely public.
* **E-commerce or Payment Processing:** If Ecovera were to sell products or accept payments for services on the site, that is not included in v1. There is no shopping cart, no online payment integration, and no paid content.
* **Blog/News Section:** While a blog or news feed could add dynamic content about sustainability tips or company updates, v1 does not include a blog. All pages are static and curated. (Future consideration: a blog using markdown posts or an external CMS could be added.)
* **Multi-language Support:** v1 will be in English only. There is no multi-language or locale switcher. Internationalization (i18n) and translations are deferred to a later phase if needed.
* **Advanced Search or Filtering:** The site has no search functionality (the content is limited and straightforward). For example, no search bar to find services or posts.
* **Interactive Web Apps or Dynamic Data:** Aside from basic form handling and animations, no complex web application features are included. For instance, no maps with live data layers, no calculators or interactive tools. A simple Google Maps embed is the most that might appear, and even that is optional.
* **Backend APIs or Databases:** There is no custom backend server (beyond what Next.js provides for static export) and no database. The contact form doesn’t save data to a database in v1. Any form submission handling to email or storage is not implemented (beyond possibly an email link). If form submission handling is desired in the future, it could be done via a serverless function or third-party service, but that’s outside v1’s scope.
* **Automated Testing:** No automated test suites (unit, integration, or end-to-end tests) are planned for v1. The developer will manually test the site. In a future iteration, especially if the project grows, adding tests or using tools like Jest/React Testing Library or Cypress for E2E could be considered.
* **Analytics and Tracking:** Except possibly adding a simple Google Analytics snippet (which is optional), there’s no detailed analytics setup or user tracking in v1. Features like event tracking, heatmaps, or cookies consent management are not included.
* **Dark Mode or Theme Switcher:** The site will have a single theme (likely light theme consistent with the brand’s colors). A toggle for dark mode or alternative themes is not in scope for the initial version.
* **Performance Optimization beyond Basics:** While basic performance considerations are in scope (image optimization, static generation), more advanced optimizations (like code-splitting beyond what Next.js handles, service workers for offline support, etc.) are not explicitly addressed in v1. The site should be performant by nature of being static, but we won’t implement things like a Progressive Web App (PWA) features in this version.

By clarifying what is out of scope, we ensure that v1 remains focused and achievable for a solo developer. These out-of-scope items help manage expectations and provide a clear boundary; they can form the feature list for v2 or beyond, once the core site is launched. The v1 website will deliver the essentials needed for a company profile and leave more complex features for future enhancement.
